# Perfect_Pitch_Training_App
A simple app for practising absolute (perfect) pitch recognition. The app plays a series of random pitches sampled from multiple octaves
and a variety of instruments. In each sequence the target note is played 3-5 times interspersed with the random pitches.
The goal is to memorize the target pitch. After a short delay (1.7 seconds) a red message ('that was not the target pitch') or a green
message ('that was the targe pitch'). This is intended to facilitate memorizing the sound of the pitch without using relative pitch.

## Getting Started
Important: only runs on windows only
- run setup.py to install required python packages
- run AP.py to launch
e.g. python AP.py X D
first argument can be X (prompt user to enter the pitch they wish to train) or A (all 12 pitches in random order)
second argument is optional to display the pitch that just played
